Al Nano-Crystals Analysis
-------------------------

The following example shows how to use the ``pyxem`` package to cluster a complex set of
Al nano-crystals. This gives a good example of how to separate overlapping diffracting structures in real space
using DBSCAN clustering.

This is a quite simple example and there are quite a few extensions that could be made to improve the results.
